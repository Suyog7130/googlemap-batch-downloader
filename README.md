googlemap-batch-downloader
==========================

This is a bash script using webkit to batch download the google satlite maps. 
As long as providing proper geo information, it can download multiple super high resolution images from googlemaps. 
This script will allow you to collect data efficiently to practice image stiching or other computer vision/image processing algorithms.
Currently this script will only run under Linux-like environment, python Qt and webkit must be installed.

The webkit2png (https://github.com/adamn/python-webkit2png) is used, the original author is Roland Tapken <roland@dau-sicher.de>.
